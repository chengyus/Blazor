These two BlazorApp and BlazorApp2 were my follow-along sample projects when following the Youtube Video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhCz4s2Gh3I
named "Let's Learn .NET - Blazor".

I really enjoyed Daniel Roth's tutorial video above in that dotnet channel (at the time when writing this README.md, about two month ago).
It was an excellent start video for learning .NET Blazor.

Coming from a Ruby senior developer background; I felt Blazor sorta was designed to integrate better than the legacy Javascript.
So, in short, it does what Microsoft designed it to be (better-scaling and peformant and modern); but when writing this README.md, I am also updating myself 
with the Java Spring Boot tech.  However, I am looking forward to the .NET 9 updates to the language/framework (if any).  And I have trained myself to 
become familiar with lots of the Quick Actions in the VSCode/VSCommunity (which is also prevalent in the IDEA Editor).  

This repo lacks the commit history of the BlazorApp2 (but if you are interviewing me, I could show those commit histories, but it was really just a follow-along).
